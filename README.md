### A Look at San Francisco's Changing Household Income

As San Francisco has become one of the largest technical hubs in the world, my team was wondering how this has affected the lives of the people who live there. One statistic we want to investigate is how household income has changed due to the tech explosion. Below is a chart created with [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/) which shows the upward trend in household income in San Francisco from 2009 to 2017. The dataset was found via the [American Factfinder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml) and was published by the [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/).

<iframe title="Chart: San Francisco Median Household Income 2009-2017" aria-describedby="This chart highlights how the median income of San Francisco households has changed throughout the years from 2009-2017. In that time, the amount of households earning more than $150k increased by about 12%. Hover over a section to see the percentage value." id="datawrapper-chart-sKgl1" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/sKgl1/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;" height="350"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px")}})}();</script>

From 2009 to 2017, the amount of households with over $150k income have increased by about 12%, while the amount earning $75k-$150k stayed about the same. The amount of households in the lowest earning brackets has dropped. Although this looks like a good sign for the citizens of San Francisco, we have yet to investigate how other factors like cost of living have been affected, and we suspect these will tell a different story.

## My First Visualization

### A Look at Lehigh University's 2017 Undergraduate Enrollment

This chart was created with [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/). It shows the enrollment of undergraduates per college at Lehigh University.

<iframe title="Chart: 2017 Lehigh University Undergraduate Enrollment" aria-describedby="This pie chart shows the percentages of undergraduate enrollment in the 6 colleges at Lehigh University in 2017. The College of Arts &amp; Sciences has the largest enrollment among all." id="datawrapper-chart-wQl3a" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wQl3a/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;" height="453"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px")}})}();</script>

This bar chart was also created with [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/) and shows the same data in a different representation.

### What About the Faculty?

This column chart shows the division of Lehigh University full-time faculty per college.

### How has enrollment changed through the years?

This line chart was created with [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/). It shows how the percentages of undergraduate enrollment have changed per college over the last 10 years.

<iframe title="Chart: Lehigh Undergraduate Enrollment Percentage Per College" aria-describedby="This chart shows the Lehigh Undergraduate enrollment percentage per college from 2008 to 2017.

This stacked column chart represents the same data with added integrated program enrollment over time.

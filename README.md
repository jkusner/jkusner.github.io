### What's Happening in #SanFrancisco?

This interactive story was created with [ArcGIS Story Maps](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html). It talks about the information gathered from a week's worth of #SanFrancisco tweets and how the data was collected. I recommend you [view the story in a separate window](https://lu.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=d332ff4848654a6e803cb8f1d0471408) for the best experience.

### The Top Average Employer Salaries in San Francisco

San Francisco is known for it's large tech presence. It one of the world's most prominent technical hubs. So it does not come as a surprise that the list of highest paying employers is dominated entirely by tech companies. Check out the chart below, which shows the highest average salaries from SF employers as users have reported on [PayScale.com](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Location=San-Francisco-CA/Salary/by_Employer). The data was scraped from this page with [ParseHub](https://www.parsehub.com/), a user friendly web-scraping tool.

<iframe title="Chart: Top Average Employer Salaries in San Francisco" aria-describedby="This bar chart shows the salaries of top paying employers in San Francisco according to user submitted profiles on PayScale.com. Interestingly, there are a few distinct groups. Tech companies dominate the top of the list with Amazon and Twitter towering over the rest. Banks and financial companies tend to be lower on the chart, probably due to hiring more than just tech workers." id="datawrapper-chart-emUDl" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/emUDl/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;" height="921"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px")}})}();</script>

### A Virtual Tour of Lehigh University

This tour was created with [Google Tour Creator](https://vr.google.com/tourcreator/).
The first 3 scenes were shot by my team with a Ricoh Theta V 4k 360 camera, but the image quality was messed up in the transfer process. The last 2 are from Google Images. Credit for the various description and audio files can be found on the tour's page.

### A Look at San Francisco's Changing Household Income

As San Francisco has become one of the largest technical hubs in the world, my team was wondering how this has affected the lives of the people who live there. One statistic we want to investigate is how household income has changed due to the tech explosion. Below is a chart created with [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/) which shows the upward trend in household income in San Francisco from 2009 to 2017. The dataset was found via the [American Factfinder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml) and was published by the [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/).

<iframe title="Chart: San Francisco Median Household Income 2009-2017" aria-describedby="This chart highlights how the median income of San Francisco households has changed throughout the years from 2009-2017. In that time, the amount of households earning more than $150k increased by about 12%. Hover over a section to see the percentage value." id="datawrapper-chart-sKgl1" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/sKgl1/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;" height="350"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px")}})}();</script>

From 2009 to 2017, the amount of households with over $150k income have increased by about 12%, while the amount earning $75k-$150k stayed about the same. The amount of households in the lowest earning brackets has dropped. Although this looks like a good sign for the citizens of San Francisco, we have yet to investigate how other factors like cost of living have been affected, and we suspect these will tell a different story.
